Assignment : Template Specialisation and the Standard Template Library

Description:
The The aim of this tutorial is to create a templated cryptographic class that can encrypt
plaintext messages and decrypt ciphertext. While the encryption algorithms themselves
are only toy examples, their implementation is achieved through the use of the
following C++ features:
	Templates
	Traits and Policies
	Template Specialisation
	STL Containers and Algorithm


Instruction:
1. Type make to compile
2. Run the 'exec' executable using command './exec' followed by the definition of the operation you would like to perform.
   e.g ./exec -i ENCRYPT -o OUTPUT -e -x 121 
This program is meant to be used on Uppercase characters and spaces.
